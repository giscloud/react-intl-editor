INSTALLATION

1. Clone the project
2. Add a folder called intl/ in the project
3. Add a folder called intl/locales/ in the project
4. Add a folder called intl/messages/ in the project
5. Copy all the json files containing the messages extracted from the source code into the intl/messages/ folder.
6. Copy any json files containing translated strings into the intl/locales/ folder.
7. Run the project's index.php file to start.

ADDING A NEW LOCALE

To add a new locale to your project, create an empty JSON file in the intl/locales/ folder with the
name of the locale.  For example /intl/en-CA.json for a Canadian English translation.  This will
add the interface elements to the editor.
